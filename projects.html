Though, this experience has become taxing as different pieces of content are often scattered over various platforms.  <br> <br> Within this target market exist various demographics (age, gender, race, ethnicity), and thus all identities must be valued as a part of the solution. <br> <br>

                        I first began the design process, by planning out a basic idea of what I wanted each page to look like. <br> <br> On the home page, I wanted users to have easy access to their recently viewed content, as well as be able to see what's currently popular on the platforms they're subscribed to. Through this, users would be able to navigate all of the trending content of their subscriptions at once, reducing the hassle to travel between multiple platforms. <br> <br> On the search page, I wanted users to interact with other users to learn more about what others may be watching and tier towards Use Case #2. Through this, users can create a network of friends and post about their own recommendations as well. <br> <br> On the home page, users should be able to keep track of all of thier posts and their network all in one place. <br><br> After wireframing and reviewing these wireframes with classmates I received feedback regarding additional features that should  be included within the platform. These included: including a way for users to either watch their content on the app or navigate to a different platform, settings page for users to adjust their preferences, and accessing other users' pages rather than only seeing what they can post/recommend. <br> <br> After listening to initial user feedback, features of the prototype were reevaluated from initial 3-screen prototype to add additional features and tier towards a larger range of use cases. <br> <br>

                    <p>
                        1. &ensp; As a user, how can you select your subscriptions and begin viewing a tv show in your recently watching? 
                    </p>
                    <p id = "performance"> - Users began by signing up for a profile and select subscriptions such as Netflix and Hulu. Following this, user was able to select "Modern Family" in the home page and begin viewing chosen episode within the Hulu platform. </p>
                    <p>
                        2. &ensp; Suppose you are looking for new content, can you search for a new show?.
                    </p>
                    <p id = "performance">  - Users navigated to search page and selected the search bar to find a new show. User then selected the show that was searched for and was navigated to the description page of the video. </p>
                    <p>
                        3. &ensp; Imagine you really enjoy the show you are currently watching, can you add a recommendation for it?.
                    </p>
                    <p id = "performance"> - Users switched to the profile page of the prototype. User proceeded to then select "Add To Now Watching" and fill out the recommendation form that followed. </p>
                    <p>
                        4. &ensp; Suppose you find a recommendation you like on the explore page, can you add them to your network?
                    </p>
                    <p id = "performance"> - Users returned to the search page where the explore page is located, selected a user then pressed the toggle bottom for follow/unfollow on the respective user profile. </p>
                    <p>
                        5. &ensp; Assume that new episode notifications are not appearing on your home screen, can you turn on notifications?
                    </p>
                    <p id = "performance"> - Users selected the settings button located on the profile page and proceeded to toggle notifications within the settings and return back to the home page. </p> <br> <br>

                        Feedback

                    <p>
                       <br> After the usability testing was complete, users commented on how the flow of the platform was intuitive. They were able to navigate between the home page, search page, and profile page to easily find the actions that needed to be taken to complete the tasks that were asked of them. <br><br> Though the layout was intuitive, one user commented on how there were minor troubles along the way. For example, on the home page, the animation assumes that the user would be able to scroll horizontally and vertically based on the orientation of the screen. Along with this, the content listed under "Continue Watching" allows users to assume they can horizontally scroll, yet this feature was not implemented. <br><br> Along with this, when user was given the task of toggling their notifications for the platform, they had mentioned that there was no way for them to manage their current subscriptions. This was an element I had looked while initially designing the platform, since users select their subscriptions at sign up. After the testing, I learned that I should also add a way for them to manage these subscriptions after registering for the platform. <br><br> Overall, the users commented that the platform suggests a straightforward response to making viewable content easier to access while adding incentivized aspects such as social networking.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the process of creating the ultimate streaming destinations for individuals, there were conscious design decisions made within the functionality and adaptability of the platform to make it top-tier. Since this platform takes inspiration from fellow streaming services, the design of the home page and individual elements, such as "Continue Watching" and "Trending", were influenced by common streaming platforms. The following additions were made to enhance the user experience:
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>  1. &ensp; Navigating Users to Watch Content on Respective Platforms Through Buttons </p>
                    <p id = "performance"> Due to licensing conflicts with the streaming service and content providers, allowing users to view their content within LINK would be nearly impossible. LINK instead allows users to view what their content is and access it through linked attachments that navigate users to the respective streaming site. </p>
                    <p>  2. &ensp; Adding Favicons To User Profiles </p>
                    <p id = "performance"> It is common user behavior to overlook specific actions in a rush. Thus, to make these actions more visible to users, I added favicons in the user profile pages such as settings icons, follow/unfollow icons, addition icons, and more to create a more visual experience for the users.</p>
                    <p>  3. &ensp; Minimalistic Scheme with Black and White Color Scheme </p>
                    <p id = "performance"> As a streaming service, as colors are prominent on posters of movies and TV shows, as well as in user profiles, a black and white color scheme was chosen to make colorful content pop on the backdrop, rather than produce contrast issues that could be confusing to the common eye. </p>
